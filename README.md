# RFIDModuleScan
RFIDModuleScan is an open source mobile application for scanning cotton modules in the field into a load list using either RFID or optical scanning.

## Platform
The application has been developed using Xamarin Forms and C# as the programming language.  To date the application has only been tested on Android.  

## Features
This application allows cotton modules in the field to be scanned into a load list.   Loads may be auto-numbered or manually numbered as modules are scanned in.  Scans for multiple farms and fields may be created, saved, and returned to at any time.  Once a scan is complete, the load list may be transmitted via email using the devices native email client.  

RFID scanning has been tested with a TSL 1128 scanner and optical scanning may be done with the device camera.
